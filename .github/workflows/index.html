      To use this website click on "forward" when you would like to move to the
      next slideshow. Click "back" to return to the last slide. This project was
      created using the coding languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a
      functional story slideshow. The collaborators and creators of this project
      include Benjamin Pecanha, 705, Ayaka Sekiguchi, 705, and Sohani Shinde.
      Our group was promised extra credit in exchange for us to create this
      project in code. The rest of the class seems to have created their
      projects in CS first, Scratch. Try opening this website on your phone!
      You'll see that even then the website is designed to adapt. This website
      will be removed from the internet after the STEM project is graded.
